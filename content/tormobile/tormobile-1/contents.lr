description:

Yes, there is a version of [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/#android) available specifically for Android. Installing Tor Browser for Android is all you need to run Tor on your Android device.

The Guardian Project provides the app [Orbot](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android) which can be used to route other apps on your Android device over the Tor network, however only Tor Browser for Android is needed to browse the web with Tor.
